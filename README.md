# Yap
Yap is a partial clone of the website 'Yelp', a popular online platform and mobile app that connects users with local businesses, primarily focusing on restaurants, bars, and various other services. I love the layout of the site as it is simple yet functional. It is easy to navigate and it's intuitive.The site has some impressive CSS features and google maps. Hopefully I can implement some of these extras. Two weeks can be a tight deadline... Moving past the deadline of the capstone project, I hope to make this clone really standout as the jewel of my resume!
